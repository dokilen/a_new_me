You will use the same techniques you used on the eyes and hair to give yourself 
new ears. Because of their shape and their position on the outside of your head, 
the ears present a unique challenge.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open your picture in Photopea</li>
  <li>Open the picture of the person whose ear you wish 
  to use</li>
  <li>Use the Lasso Tool to draw a selection 
  area around one of the ears</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">Copy the ear 
	selection and paste it onto your face</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Rename the new layer containing the ear to L_Ear (or R_Ear depending on which one you used)</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Transform/Warp the ear so that it matches the 
  scale of your head</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Position the new ear on top of your old 
  one</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Use the Eraser Tool with a solid edge -  Hard Round brush set to 20 pixels works well - to trim any background 
  or remaining face parts from your new ear</li>
</ol>
<p>If you can no longer see your ears thanks to your new hair, it is no big 
deal. Simply move the new ear layer above your new hair layer so you have what 
you see in the image below...</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="4%20ears/00.jpg" width="233" height="324"></p>
<p>It is unlikely that your new ear is the same size as your old ear. We will 
need to do a little covering up to make our ear look natural. Take a look at the 
graphic below...</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none" align="center">
<img border="0" src="4%20ears/01.jpg" width="314" height="289"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; color: black"><a name="clone"></a>Notice that inside the 
circles on the left you can see pieces of&nbsp; the old ear, but no longer in the image on the 
right. This was easily accomplished using the </span> 
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; ">Clone Stamp 
Tool</span><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; color: black">, 
which allows you to select a portion of the image you would like to copy as you 
draw on your image. In other words, we can actually extend a portion of the new 
ear so that it is larger and covers more area.</span></p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="9">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Click on the Clone Stamp Tool...<br>
  <img border="0" src="4%20ears/02.jpg"></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Determine what portion of the image you would 
  like to copy, in the ear example above we are going to fix the problem at the 
  top of the ear by using other parts of the ear - notice that the Clone Stamp 
  Tool's normal shape is a circle...<br>
  <img border="0" src="4%20ears/03.jpg" width="96" height="88"></li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="color: black; font-family: TimesNewRoman">We want to make a section 
of the ear just above the problem area and copy it down over the original ear. 
To do this, we need to let Photopea know the area we want to copy (or clone) 
and then we can begin drawing.</span></p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="11">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Be certain you are using a large enough brush: 5-10 seems to work well for what we are doing</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Position the cursor over the area you wish to 
  clone (the part of the image you wish to copy)</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Press and hold the Alt key - the cursor 
  should turn into a target...<br>
  <img border="0" src="4%20ears/04.jpg" width="148" height="212"></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Click the spot where you want to begin 
  cloning and release the Alt key- it will look as though nothing happened, but 
	Photopea has  
  placed a marker at that spot</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Move to the area you wish to draw over and begin 
  drawing by clicking and holding the left mouse button and dragging the 
  mouse around to draw over the area we no longer want - Photopea replaces what is currently there with whatever is located 
  at the target you placed in the above direction...<br>
  <img border="0" src="4%20ears/32.jpg" width="148" height="212"></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Draw in small strokes to keep the work 
  manageable - it will be necessary to reset your target often - as you draw, a plus will appear at the target area to let you know where you are pulling 
  color from while a circle appears at the spot you are dropping color to</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Continue clone-stamping until the ear looks natural</li>
</ol>
<p>Using the Clone Stamp Tool takes some getting used 
to - take your time and work slowly until you get what you want. Don't 
freak out if it does not work immediately - nothing works perfectly the first 
time you use it. Remember that we want the new pieces of our head to look as 
realistic as possible, so make sure that everything blends together nicely and 
has no obvious edges or extra pieces.</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="18">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  If the new ear is a different skin tone, use 
  Photopea's Adjustments Tools to make the skin color match yours</li>
</ol>
<p>When finished, you should have a nice looking ear...</p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="4%20ears/05.jpg" width="126" height="278"></p>
<ol start="19">
  <li>Repeat the above directions to 
  create the other ear</li>
  <li>Save As PSD in your A New Me folder as ANewMe_name.psd</li>
</ol>
<p align="left">
By now you should be looking sufficiently freakish. Remember that each new 
facial feature you add should be on its own layer. We have two more features to 
replace: the mouth and nose.</p>
