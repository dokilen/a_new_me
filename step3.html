<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; color: black">We will use the same 
process of selecting and dragging that we used on the eyes to get other pieces 
of our new face into place. For the hair, we will use an extremely useful tool 
that will make selecting the hair much easier: the
<span style="color: black; font-family:TimesNewRoman">Magnetic Lasso Tool</span>. 
This tool allows us to make a selection by dragging around the outside of an 
area where a contrast in colors exists. For example, let's say I want to select 
the hair of the following person...</span></p>
<p align="center">
<img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/3%20hair/02.jpg" width="200" height="231"></p>
<p align="left">
We could do it with the regular Lasso Tool and then use the Eraser Tool to remove all of 
the unwanted area, but an easier way is to select the Magnetic Lasso Tool
and select just the hair. Notice how the hair is significantly darker then the 
surrounding area. This contrast creates an excellent line that the Magnetic 
Lasso Tool can use to create a selection area.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open your picture in Photopea</li>
  <li>Make sure your hair is able to be replaced - it should not sit too far off 
  the top of your head</li>
</ol>
<p>Take a look at Niel's hair in the image below...</p>
<p align="center">
  <img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/3%20hair/06.jpg" width="281" height="332"></p>
<p>Notice that his hair sits a significant distance off the top of his head. It 
will be difficult to replace his hair with someone else's hair simply because we 
are forced to choose someone with equally high hair. There are several ways we 
can address this issue, so let's take a look at two of them. Remember, the 
following two directions only apply if you have lots of hair.</p>
<ol start="3">
  <li>Use the Clone Stamp Tool (how the Clone 
  Stamp Tool works is covered in <a href="step4.html#clone">the Ear step</a>) to remove the 
  top of your hair, as I did with Niel below...<br>
<img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/3%20hair/07.jpg" width="140" height="172"><br>
  Note that it is now far easier to find someone with hair that will work</li>
  <li>Use 
  the Magnetic Lasso Tool described in this Step to select your hair, invert the 
  selection so that you have everything but your hair selected, and copy and 
  paste your face on a new layer, then simply turn off the visibility of the original background layer 
  thus making your current hair 'invisible' (yeah, it is kinda 
  complicated...just do the Clone Stamp thing)</li>
</ol>
<p>Which of the two above methods you choose to deal with your hair is up to you, but remember that part of your grade depends 
  on your new hair looking natural. Take the time to make it look good.</p>
<ol start="5">
  <li>
  <p>Open the picture of the person whose hair you wish 
  to use</li>
</ol>
  <p>Note that you do not have to use all of the hair from the new person. If 
  there are specific parts you like (or don't like), you are free to use those 
  areas. Keep in mind that for the Magnetic Lasso Tool to work that there must 
  be a definite contrast between the area you want to select and the area 
  surrounding it (one area needs to be dark while the other is light).<ol start="6">
  <li>
  Click the Magnetic Lasso Tool...<br>
  <span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; color: black">
	<img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/3%20hair/01.jpg" align="absbottom"></span></li>
  <li>
  Set the Feather amount on the Magnetic Lasso Tool's options bar to 2...<br>
  <span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; color: black">
  <img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/3%20hair/12.jpg" align="absbottom"></span></li>
  <li>
  Determine the best place to click to begin 
  your selection - for my image, the best place to start is the point of hair by 
  his left ear...<br>
<img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/3%20hair/08.jpg" width="112" height="181"></li>
  <li>
  Click where you want to begin your 
  selection</li>
  <li>Slowly (yes, slowly!) move your cursor around the area you 
  want to select - as in the graphic below where we are moving the Magnetic 
  Lasso Tool around the hair - and Photopea will automatically drop 
  selection handles around our area for us...<br>
  <img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/3%20hair/03.jpg" width="275" height="210"><br>
  I know, cool huh?</li>
  <li>Enclose the selection area by either clicking 
  back on the first selection box, or by double-clicking somewhere on the screen 
  - once complete, we will have a selection 
  similar to the one below...<br>
  <img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/3%20hair/04.jpg" width="231" height="205"></li>
</ol>
<p align="left">
Not bad, but there are few problems. The selections we get with this tool are 
generally rounded and not exceptionally precise. Notice near the ears that the 
pointed areas of hair did not get selected, and that there are perhaps segments 
across the forehead that we might want to add or remove...</p>
<p align="center">
  <img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/3%20hair/09.jpg" width="231" height="205"></p>
<p align="left">
We can add to or remove from our current selection by holding down specific keys 
on the keyboard while we use the Lasso Tool.</p>
<ol start="12">
  <li>Click the Lasso Tool</li>
  <li>Hold down the Shift key - notice that 
  the cursor now includes a tiny plus sign with the lasso...<br>
  <img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/3%20hair/10.jpg" width="48" height="40"><br>
  Draw a selection 
  area around whatever you want to add to the selection - when you release the 
  mouse button and the Shift key that area should now have the dashed line around it</li>
  <li>Hold down the Alt key - notice that 
  the cursor now includes a tiny minus sign with the lasso...<br>
  <img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/3%20hair/11.jpg" width="48" height="40"><br>
  Draw a 
  selection area around whatever you want to remove from the selection - when you 
  release the mouse button and the Alt key that area should no longer have the 
  dashed line around 
  it</li>
  <li>Continue to make adjustments in your hair 
  selection until you have a 
  selection that you are more happy with, such as the one below...<br>
  <img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/3%20hair/05.jpg" width="501" height="381"><br>
  Notice that the accuracy of the outline has been improved, but is still not 
  perfect as it is nearly impossible to get EVERY hair in this scenario</li>
</ol>
<p>I should probably mention that there are ways to get an almost perfect 
selection, but those methods are considerably more complicated than what we want 
to do, so let's go with what we have created so far. If you are interested in 
creating a more precise selection of hair, look online for directions on making 
hair selections using Channels.</p>
<p align="left">
We now have to get the new hair onto our image.</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="16">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Press Ctrl+C to copy the hair selection to the clipboard</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Return to your head file and press Ctrl+V to paste the new hair - notice that 
	Photopea has created a new 
  layer and placed the hair on it</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Rename the new layer containing the hair to Hair</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Resize the hair so that it matches the 
  scale of your head</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Position the new hair on top of your head</li>
</ol>
<p>Since all of our pictures were taken with different backgrounds, it is likely 
that you will may have extra 'stuff' around your head to have to clean up. 
If you do have areas that you need to get rid of, use the Eraser Tool to fix it.</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="21">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Use the Eraser Tool to remove any unwanted parts of the hair and to smooth out 
  any hard edges</li>
</ol>
<p>Keep something important in mind: by setting the Magnetic Lasso Tool's 
feather to 2 we made sure that the edge of our hair is nice and soft...</p>
<p align="center">
  <img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/3%20hair/14.jpg" width="323" height="110"></p>
<p>If you happen to have any areas that resemble the left image above, simply 
use the Eraser Tool to soften the edge so that it resembles the right image 
above.</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="22">
  <li>
  <p align="left">Save As PSD in your A New Me folder as ANewMe_name.psd</li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align: left; text-autospace: none">
That should do it for creating our new hair. Since we don't have to worry about 
matching skin tones we don't need to worry about 
using the Adjustments tools this time around.</p>
