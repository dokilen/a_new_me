<p class="MsoBodyText">We will replace both of your eyes, but do so one at a 
time. This will make it easier to smooth out the edges and blend in the color.</p>

	<li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Be sure your head is open in <b>Photopea</b> and 
  that it is a <b>PSD</b> file (which you should have saved in Step 1)</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  <b>Open</b> the head of another person you wish to pull the 
  eyes from in <b>Photopea</b></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">

  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Make sure 
    <strong><em>Feather is set to zero</em></strong> in the options bar and then draw a selection area 
  around the other person's left eye<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman">...<br>

  <img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/2%20eyes/02.jpg" width="299" height="175"></li>
</ol>
<p>Remember that the Lasso Tool allows you to draw a selection area of any shape and size, so 
  be sure you select enough of the area around the eye to actually change the shape of your 
entire eye instead of just replace the eyeball.</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="5">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none"><span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman">When you have your selection, press 
	<b>ctrl+J</b> to copy it to a new layer.</span> </li>
  <li class="MsoNormal">
    Use the <b>Move Tool</b> to drag the eye selection onto the<strong> TITLE TAB</strong> of the picture of
    your face. Drop it on the title tab.<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman"> (you must change to the 
  Move Tool or you will simply be dragging your selection around...example is in the video above)<br>
	NOTE: It take a minute for Photopea to catch up with the move. Don't drag too many times or you will have multiple layers of the same thing!<br>
    <img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/2%20eyes/04.jpg" width="298" height="182"><br>

<p>Let's get the new eye to be the same size as your eye.</p>

  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">

  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  The eye should now have <b>resize handles</b> around it 
  (the 8 little empty boxes in the image below are the resize handles)...<br>

  Alternately, you can use one of the corner resize handles to adjust the 
  eye's height and width at the same time until it is the correct size
  (you don't have to use the same corner handle as I did...use whichever one you 
  want)...<br>
	<img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/2%20eyes/10.jpg" width="299" height="169"><br>Keep in mind that if you hold down the Shift 
  key while you resize that Photopea will resize both the width and height at the same 
  time</li>

  Use the <b>Move tool</b> to place the eye in the proper position</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>ROTATING THE EYE</b></p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; color: black">It never fails: someone 
in their picture has their head tilted, or turned, or is looking up or down, or 
something along those lines (it may have even been YOU). If you want to use 
features from one of these people, </span>it will be necessary for you to 
rotate the new eye so that it more preciously matches your current eye. Let's 
take a quick look at how to do this (if you don't need to rotate an eye, simply read 
through the following section as you may need to rotate another piece of face 
that you are using from another person's photo later in this project).</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="12">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Make sure the new eye is selected and is in the 
  correct position</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Click <b>Edit</b> then point at <b>Transform</b> then 
  click <b>Rotate</b></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  You should now have the selection box with resize 
  handles...<br>
  <span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman">
  <img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/2%20eyes/12.jpg" width="316" height="287"></span></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Point at the image just off the box...<br>
  <img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/2%20eyes/13.jpg" width="276" height="250"><br>
  Notice that your cursor has changed to a curved, double-headed arrow - this is 
  what we want</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Click and drag to Rotate the  eye until it sits at the correct 
  angle<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman">...<br>
  </span>
	<img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/2%20eyes/14.jpg" width="170" height="213"></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Press <b>Enter</b> to apply the transformation</li>
</ol>
<p>
<b>SHARP EDGES</b></p>
<p>With the eye in the proper position and approximately the correct size, we 
can now begin to smooth it out and get it looking like it belongs on your face.<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; color: black"> 
Hard, sharp, and unnatural looking edges will cause your image to look 
artificial and will cost you valuable points, so always take the time to make 
sure that your new facial items blend in with your face and look as natural as 
possible. Look at the graphic below...</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none" align="center">
<img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/2%20eyes/15.jpg" width="197" height="122"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; color: black">Notice the hard edge 
between the new eye and the original face? Once again, we have an easy fix in 
these situations.</span></p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="18">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Select the <b>Eraser Tool</b> and use the <b>Soft Round</b> brush</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Set the size to <b>30</b> pixels and be ready to adjust it (the <b>[ </b>key makes the brush smaller 
  while the <b>]</b> key makes it larger) to whatever size works best for your face</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Click around the edge of the eye - note that you DO NOT 
  want to click and drag, instead you want to just click, move your mouse to a different spot around the 
  eye and click again, move your mouse to a different spot, etc.)</li>
</ol>
<p>Notice that when you click, the edge will appear smooth and will seem to 
blend into the background.</p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="21">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Gradually work around the outside of the eye to remove the hard edge to create 
	a smooth transition...<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman"><br>
  <img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/2%20eyes/16.jpg" width="315" height="148"><br>
  Again, don't click and drag - it will not look natural</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; color: black">This is a good time to 
point out that not every facial feature will look perfect (or even good) when 
placed on your face. All of our faces are a different shape, and you will be 
morphing the pieces to fit your face. It is OK that it does not look perfect 
(in fact, it is not supposed to look perfect...where is the fun in that?).</span></p>
<p><b>ADJUSTING SKIN COLOR</b></p>
<p>One final issue we need to deal with is that we all have different skin 
color, but we want our final product to appear as natural as possible. The skin 
around your new eye is likely lighter or darker than your actual skin color...</p>
<p align="center">
  <img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/2%20eyes/07.jpg" width="356" height="194"></p>
<p>This is a good time to point out that if you do not have any skin around your 
eye <b><font size="5" color="#800000">YOU DID IT WRONG</font></b>. As discussed 
earlier, you need to include the area around their eye and not just the eyeball 
so that you actually reshape your eyes and not just give yourself different 
colored pupils. If this applies to you, delete your eye layer and go back right 
now and do it correctly, otherwise you will loose points.</p>
<p>Correcting the skin tone problem involves using Photopea's Adjustments 
tool...</p>
<ol start="22">
  <li>
  With the new eye selected, click Image and 
  then point at Adjustments...<br>
  <img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/2%20eyes/08.jpg" width="477" height="510"></li>
</ol>
<p>Which Adjustment you use depends on the two images you are trying to match up, so you will need to 
  experiment with several of them until you find one that does the job. This tutorial will
  NOT go into detail of how all of the Adjustments work. Use the sliders to adjust the color of 
  the new eye and be sure the Preview box is 
  checked so you can immediately see the changes you make. All of the adjustments have a different 
  impact, but you likely 
  want to give Levels, Hue/Saturation, Desaturate, Brightness/Contrast, or Color 
  Balance a try first. Keep in mind that it may be necessary to use more than 
  one Adjustment to get the desired result - just experiment until the new eye's 
skin color matches your face's natural skin color. You have worked 
  with the various Adjustment tools enough up to this point to know how they 
  work and what you need to do.</p>
<p>
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; color: black">I can not tell you 
exactly how to do this, you must use trial and error to figure it out. There are 
far too many skin color variations and combination possibilities for us to 
discuss how all of them work, so </span>
you are on 
your own this time<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; color: black">. 
Don't worry, I am confident in your ability to figure this out.</span></p>
<ol start="23">
  <li>
  Use whatever method is appropriate to match the skin color of your new eye to 
  your natural skin color</li>
</ol>
<p><b>REPAIRING SHADOW</b></p>
<p>If the problem is not skin color but shadow, we must use a different 
solution. This process is really only necessary if your face
<span style="font-family: TimesNewRoman; color: black">has significant shadows, 
which it should not if the original picture was taken correctly. If the eyes you 
pulled off another person have shadows, you can use the color variation tips 
above to correct this. If your face is the one with the shadow, you need to add 
shadows to the new eyes so they match your face, here is how to do it.</span></p>
<ol style="margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: 0in" start="24">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Make sure the eyes are in the correct position</li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Use the Brush Tool with the airbrush enabled, black foreground color, the Opacity set to 20%, and the transparency locked 
  (this is located on our layers panel just above the name of our first 
  layer)...<br>
  <img border="0" src="../A%20New%20Me%20COVID/2%20eyes/17.jpg" width="240" height="121"></li>
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Gradually draw over the eyes until the 
  shading approximates the shading on your face</li>
</ol>
<p>We have done a great deal of detailed work, but at this point we only have 
one new eye. So.............</p>
<ol start="27">
  <li class="MsoNormal" style="color: black; text-autospace: none">
  Repeat the above directions to create the other eye</li>
</ol>
<p>When finished, you should have two new eyes that reshape your eyes, are the 
correct size and orientation, have smooth edges so they blend into your face, 
and match your skin tone...</p>
