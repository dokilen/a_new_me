<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">This lesson will cover 
some new uses for many of the Photopea tools we have been working with as well as 
introduce you to some new, very useful tools. We will be working with 
the headshot photos we took in class to build a new you. You will use the faces 
of <u> <b>five</b></u> famous people to build a new face for yourself. When finished, you 
should have an interesting image that looks somewhat natural, but mostly freaky. Smile, this is 
fun.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><font color="#800000"><b>A word of caution:</b></font> as you 
have already worked through the Student Astronaut (Space Scene) project, these 
instructions will not cover <i>every single</i> step and tell you how to do <i>every 
single</i> thing, though it will discuss the new techniques in more detail. Remember 
that if these instructions refer to something but do not discuss it in depth, that 
means that you should have already learned it. If you didn't learn it, it is your 
responsibility to refer back to the Space 
Scene 
tutorial, or hit the Photopea help section to figure it out. If those fail, work 
with another student to to solve your problem. If all else fails, ask your teacher...but they are your last resorts (take some pride in your work and attempt to 
solve your own problems - you will enjoy this process much more if you are doing 
the work yourself).</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font color="#800000"><b>Before we begin, since you will be saving 5+ pictures of other people, please make a folder where you save your Photopea projects called: A New Me</b></font>. It will be easier to locate your materials if they are all in one place.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Launch Photopea and open your headshot (we used it in Space Scene)</li>
  <li>Choose: File/Save As PSD (in your A New Me folder)</li>
  <li>Name the file: ANewMe_name.psd (replacing YOUR name for the word NAME)</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">We are going to pull 
  pieces off of other people's heads and use those pieces to replace various 
  parts of your head. <strong>Take some time to look through the photos of all of the other people and choose five that you 
  can use.</strong> You will be replacing the following five facial features: </span> <b>
  <span style="color:#800000">eyes</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt">,</span><b><span style="color:#800000"> hair</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt">, </span> <b>

<p>4. <a href="photos.htm">Click here</a> to view the headshot photos and when you find one, right-mouse click the picture, Save As, and save it into the folder in which you save all of your Photopea 
projects</p>
<p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">For these directions, I have chosen five  
  faces at random, and assigned facial parts to transfer to my original face. 
For your image, you can use whoever you wish, but you must replace the five facial features 
  indicated below. Keep the following in mind as you choose replacements for each 
  part:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>
  <p><b><span style="color:#800000">Eyes</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><ul><li> 
    This includes the eye itself as well as the eye lashes and the area around 
    it - you MUST use more than just the iris (the colored part), as it is easy to 
    change a person's iris without it even looking like a change was made (and 
    you don't even need another person to do it, you can just change the 
    Hue/Saturation)</li><li> 
    We want to reshape the entire eye, and not just replacement the eyeball 
    itself</span></li></ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><b><span style="color:#800000">Hair</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><ul><li>If you 
  have lots of hair it will be difficult to remove it all and replace it with 
    someone else's, so consider retaking your picture with your hair pulled back</span></li></ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><b><span style="color:#800000">Ears</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><ul><li>
    Be sure 
  the people you choose to use do not have hair covering their ears (notice that in three of the six 
  photos above the ears are unusable)</li><li>If your picture has hair covering your 
  ears, you will simply need to add in someone else's ears and place them over 
  your hair (in other words, you don't get to skip this part because your ears 
    are hard to see - you still have to give yourself new ears)</span></li></UL>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><b><span style="color:#800000">Mouth</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><ul><li>&nbsp;Choose 
    a mouth that is of approximately the same size to your own, or one that can be easily scaled without 
  looking silly (in other words, if you have a huge head don't choose a person 
  with a tiny mouth)</span></li></ul>
  </li>
  <li>
  <p><b><span style="color:#800000">Nose</span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><ul><li> 
    Make sure 
  your nose choice can be easily blended into the surrounding skin</span></li></ul>
</ul>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
Try to choose people with facial features different enough from yours that it 
actually makes a difference to your face.
When finished, we should end up with an entirely different face...</p>

<p>The first facial feature that we will replace is the eyes. You are free to 
use any of the images from the <a href="photos.htm">photo page</a> that you want 
- when you see someone whose eyes you like, right mouse the picture and save it in your A New Me Folder that you created 
at the start of this step. When you save, name the picture with the body part (eye, nose, mouth...). Please do not look up other pictures 
on the Internet or spend too much time browsing these photos - just pick 
something and move on.</p>
