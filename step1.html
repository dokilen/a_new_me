<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt">For this Photopea project, 
we are going to focus on one of the most image manipulations: making items that 
don't below look like they are part of an image. To do this, we are going to 
take a headshot (selfie) of you and replace individual pieces of your face with 
parts of faces from <u> <b>five</b></u> famous people to build a new face. When finished, you 
should have an interesting image that looks somewhat natural, a little freaky, 
and a lot awesome. Smile, this is 
fun.</span></p>

though it will discuss some tools and techniques in detail. If these 
instructions refer to something but do not discuss it in depth and you do not 
understand, it is your responsibility to look further at the issue to figure it 
out. Take pride in your work and attempt to solve your own problems - you will 
enjoy this process much more if you are doing the work yourself.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><font color="#800000"><b>Since you will be saving 5+ pictures of other people, 
you will need to make a folder to save all of your work</b></font>. It will be easier to locate your materials if they are all in one place.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a folder on your device named <b>A New Me</b> - you will save all 
	work for this project in that folder</li>
	<li><span style="display: inline; float: none">You will 
	need a headshot image for this project, so either find an existing image of 
	you or take a new headshot</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="MsoBodyText">
<span style="display: inline; float: none">The directions for 
this project assume that the headshot you are using is a straight on view, 
meaning your head is NOT tilted or turned in any way. All of the celebrity 
images you have to choose from are pictures straight view pictures. The point 
here is simple: using a straight on picture will make your work in this project 
much easier. Additionally, you will want to use an image that is fairly large. 
Not huge - though it will work, it will limit the celebrity facial features you 
will able to use - but not too small. If your image is on the large side things 
will go much smoother. Avoid thumbnails or other such small images. It also 
helps if your head covers most of the image, as it will make detail work much 
easier.</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">
<span style="display: inline; float: none">Finally, simple 
backgrounds tend to work best. While not a requirement, a simple background will 
be a lot easier to work with when you are doing such things are replacing your 
hair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">We are going to pull

</ol>
<p><span style="font-size:12.0pt">For these directions, I have chosen five  
  faces at random, and assigned facial parts to transfer to my original face. 
For your image, you can use whoever you wish, but you must replace the five facial features 
  indicated below. Keep the following in mind as you choose replacements for each 
  part:</span></p>
<ul>
  <li>
<b><span style="color:#800000"><font size="5">Eyes</font></span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><ul><li> 
    This includes the eye itself as well as the eye lashes and the area around 
    it - you MUST use more than just the iris (the colored part), as it is easy to 
    change a person's iris without it even looking like a change was made (and 
    you don't even need another person to do it, you can just change the 
    Hue/Saturation)</li><li> 
    We want to reshape the entire eye, and not just replacement the eyeball 
    itself</span></li></ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<b><span style="color:#800000"><font size="5">Hair</font></span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><ul><li>If you 
  have lots of hair it will be difficult to remove it all and replace it with 
    someone else's, so consider retaking your picture with your hair pulled back</span></li></ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<b><span style="color:#800000"><font size="5">Ears</font></span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><ul><li>
    Be sure 
  the people you choose to use do not have hair covering their ears (notice that in three of the six 
  photos above the ears are unusable)</li><li>If your picture has hair covering your 
  ears, you will simply need to add in someone else's ears and place them over 
  your hair (in other words, you don't get to skip this part because your ears 
    are hard to see - you still have to give yourself new ears)</span></li></UL>
  </li>
  <li>
<b><span style="color:#800000"><font size="5">Mouth</font></span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><ul><li>&nbsp;Choose 
    a mouth that is of approximately the same size to your own, or one that can be easily scaled without 
  looking silly (in other words, if you have a huge head don't choose a person 
  with a tiny mouth)</span></li></ul>
  </li>
  <li>
<b><span style="color:#800000"><font size="5">Nose</font></span></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><ul><li> 
    Make sure 
  your nose choice can be easily blended into the surrounding skin</span></li></ul>
</ul>

Try to choose people with facial features different enough from yours that it 
actually makes a difference to your face.
When finished, we should end up with an entirely different face...</p>

<p>The first facial feature that we will replace is the eyes. You are free to 
use any of the images from the <a href="photos.htm">photo page</a> that you want 
- when you see someone whose eyes you like, right mouse click the picture and save it in your A New Me Folder that you created 
at the start of this step. When you save, name the picture with the body part (eye, nose, mouth...). Please do not look up other pictures 
on the Internet or spend too much time browsing these photos - just pick 
something and move on.</p>
